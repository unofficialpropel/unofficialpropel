Jetstream is an amazing app for Salesforce Administration!  It allows you to dig in deep to your Salesforce Orgs with an awesome and fast UI.  

Some Examples:
- Interact with objects and write SOQL with just clicks
- Mass update records in seconds
- Bulk export and import data in multiple formats
- Export data to JSON to use AI for complex data manupliations
- Create fields on objects in bulk!
- Migrate metadata between orgs
- Use a much nicer version of the SF developer console
