# Folge

> Skill Level: âœ… Beginner

Folge is a documentation tool to quickly generate guides and instructions to users and admins alike.  It is used to build many of the tutorials on this site!  Folge is similar to Scribe or other documentation tools, however it is not cloud based, its a desktop app.  There are pro-cons to this, however for many with strict IT security, this is a great option. Check out some [comparisons](https://folge.me/compare).  The licensing is one time as well with no reoccuring subscription charges.
